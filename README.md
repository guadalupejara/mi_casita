# Mi_Casita
**`Full Stack Project`**

This app was created as inspired from DAKboard for a customizable display used on tablets. The idea for this project was inspired for creating a centralized home organization system by including multi UI calander managment, sticky notes, reminders, lists, and messaging system. The goal is to also make it kid friendly by providing extra features like drawing board, emoji stickers, and sticky notes.
